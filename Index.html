      <h1>I LOVE YOU BIGTIME</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>Hi baby, my Aa, LOML, I just want to greet u, HAPPY 9 MONTHS OF LOVE.Every day we spend together feels like the first day because I can't help but fall in love with you all over again. I wish that all the hard works that we made in this relationship will make us stronger as we was before, no matter how many times we fight, at the end of the day mas mangingibabaw pa rin yung pagmamahal ko sayo. Thank you for understanding me every time na  magagalit or mawawala ako sa mood and thank you because after all those arguments hindi mo pa rin ako pinapabayaan at palagi tayong nagkakaayos. Thankful ako sa kung ano ka, maybe sometimes natitriggered ako sa mga words na binibitawan mo and for me dapat alam mo kung paano at gaano ako kasensitive but anyways nasasabi ko naman yung nafifeel ko pag hindi tayo ayos at siyempre pag maayos rin tayo. Thank you for making me always comfortable sa mga bagay bagay and especially thank you for sticking even in bad days. There are no words I could use to describe the love we share. All the bond that we made and we will make will be my forever treasure.Iâ€™m so incredibly thankful for you. I'm so grateful that I have u, alam mo if someone asked me about my ideal man, I wouldn't have had the words to describe you. You have surpassed all expectations, fantasies, and dreams combined.  I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MY Aa!! HAPPY NINE MONTHS OF LOVE!!.</p>
